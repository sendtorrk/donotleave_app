# Do Not Leave 

Heatstroke is the leading cause of non-crash, vehicle-related deaths for children. An average of 38 children have died in hot cars each year in the USA alone. Data shows that heatstroke deaths can occur any month of the year. More than half of heat stroke deaths occur because a parent or caregiver forgot the child in the car.

Cars heat up quickly. A vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 10 minutes. The body temperatures of children can increase three to five times faster than adults.

So never leave a child or pet alone in a motor vehicle.

Do Not Leave is a free app to alert the driver that a child or pet may have been left in the motor vehicle. It uses a combination of advanced location and motion technologies that are available on the latest Apple iOS based devices to alert drivers.

# How it works ?

That's it. You can now close the app. The Do Not Leave app will continuously process your location and motion information in the background to alert you. You don't have to even remember to run this app before you start driving!
